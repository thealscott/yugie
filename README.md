# The Tale of Yugie


## Birth
Born into a fair sized Dray Clan (the Desert Maw Clan | Bekilk Narod Svihelen) located in the wastes west of Draj, Yugie was marked out, even as a hatchling, for great things.

Although he was not blessed with magical ability, many of his clan were and served as Spellscale sorcerers for hire, often employed by Tektuctitlay, the Sorcerer King of Draj for both combat and research.

*The clan often did business with the Sorcerer King of Draj (Tektuctitlay), trading in goods, slaves and offering mercenary services. Of course, they also often served for other private individuals, but the Sorcerer King was the primary client. As a result of the good relations with Draj historically enjoyed by the Desert Maw Clan, they rarely had any trouble from the city, and prospererd.*

*Tektuctitlay is known for being obsessed with both gaining power and with his pet drakes, which he breeds. For many years Dray sorcerers from Yugie's clan have been employed to help in draconic research (two main branches: augmenting the power of his Drakes and research into Dregoth and draconic ascension).*

## Youth
As a non-sorcerer, Yugie could have either followed the path of a merchant or a Clanblade. Being the adventurous type right from his hatching, he chose to pursue the path of the Clanblade. 

Trained in the martial arts, his prowess as a quick thinking and natural combat leader was soon recognised and he was trained not only how to wield blade and shield, but also in tactics, strategy and leadership.

*The tradition of the Desert Maw Clan, which has a high proportion of magically gifted members, is for each aspirant Spellscale sorcerer in training to be partnered with one or several aspirant Clanblades from the beginning of their training.*

*The combat traditions of the Desert Maw emphasise combined arms, mixing martial and magical fighting techniques in a balanced manner, and this grouping system meant that they train in these techniques togther from their first day. It also helps form strong bonds between the clan mates, who will often serve together in the same groups they trained in as mercenaries or as escorts for the clan merchants.*

Marked out as exceptional from early on, Yugie was partnered with a female Spellscale prodigy named Ysidra and another promising male fighter named Yeloth. Yugie and Yeloth trained in the martial arts under Hragnar 'Hammerblow', the brother of the Clan chief and master of the warriors. It was considered a great honour to be apprenticed to Hragnar himself, widely considred the best warrior of the Clan. 

Ysidra was trained by the no less renowned Ethelas, one of the most powerful mages the clan had produced in generations. 

The three of them excelled in training, and were regarded with a mixture of pride and jealousy within the clan.

At age 16, they completed their training. It was traditional at this stage for the youths to complete a final test; a coming of age ritual which involved a journey to the mountains west of the tribal lands. There they would have to battle and kill some kind of desert creature to prove their training was effective, bringing back a trophy of their victory. Honour and social status could be gained by slaying larger and more dangerous creatures. 

The arrogance of youth and their perceived superiority to the other aspirants of the clan meant that the trio bit off far more than they could chew on their journey. While most aspirants would choose something like a wild Crodlu or Baazrag as their prey, Yugie, Yeloth and Ysidra happened upon a adolescent Earth Drake, probably escaped from the breeding pens of Draj. Even though it was already wounded (presumably from it's escape or from combat with other creatures since) it proved to be far too much for the trio to handle.

Yeloth was gravely wounded, losing an arm and an eye to the beast, and the three barely escaped with their lives. 

The shame of returning having failed and of their arrogance resulting in Yeloth being crippled would follow them for the rest of their lives. Yeloth was forced to join the merchants as he could no longer wield a blade, while Yugie and Ysidra were forced to repeat the last year of training, this time under much less auspicious tutors.

Yugie and Ysidra embarked on the rite of passage for the second time a year later. This time their ambition was tempered by shame and caution, and while their trophy was still significant (they tracked and slew a wild Cilops), it could never totally erase their dishonour.

## Adulthood

Having completed their rite of passage, the pair were now made available to be hired for mercernary work, and for the escort of the clan merchants.

Their first few jobs were unremarkable, a mix of small time jobs for private individuals who needed some muscle and escorting caravans to Draj.

After a year of such mundane assignments, the pair were contracted to Tektuctutlay (along with a score of others) to assist him in his draconic research. Yugie would act as bodyguard and assistant to Ysidra, who was the primary contractor. 

Although not magically inclined, Yugie was intelectually adept, and found that although being cloistered in the mad Sorcerer King's temples and libraries was not quite the life of adventure that he had envisioned when he set out to become a Clanblade, his appetite for knowledge was growing and the vast array of books and scrolls availble to him in his role as Ysidra's assistant/bodyguard would first sate, then further grow that thirst for knowledge.

For about two years he and Ysidra were resident in the temples and libraries hidden away in Two Moon City and they carried out extensive research through the collected tomes on the origin and nature of the Dray, and their connections to Dregoth.

After those two years, Tektuctitlay laid out his master plan: he wanted to send an expedition to the ruins of Guistenal. The expedition would excavate the site and find as much information about Dregoth, the Dray and his attempts at Draconic ascension as possible.

After several hard weeks of sailing across the Silt Sea, surviving several pirate attacks and a few minor adventures along the way, Yugie, Ysidra and the 20 or so other members of the expedition arrived at the ruins of Guistenal. 

What they discovered shortly though, was that the city was not as dead as the world at large believed. Within a few days of setting up camp in the ruins, they came under repeated attacks. They were cut off from their lines of retreat and could not make any attempt to escape. They managed to fortify themselves in a ruined building, and held their attackers at bay for several days, but eventually they were overwhelmed.

Although they gave good account of themselves, the whole expedition was slaughtered. 

After the blackness of death, Yugie awoke to find himself in the dim darkness of what would emerge to be the undercity of Guistenal, where Dregoth had persisted in undeath, raising an army of undead in secret. With Ysidra nowhere to be found, Yugie stepped forth, with a strange burning sensation in his chest...
